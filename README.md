## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm definitely proud of how I implemented the cascade effect of both the ratings and the testimonials. I set up a grid layout and then utilized Kevin Pennekamp's [nth-child CSS trick](https://crinkles.dev/writing/a-nth-child-css-trick/). Here is the CSS for the ratings:

```css
.ratings-list {
  --cascade: 48px;
  grid-template-columns: var(--cascade) var(--cascade) 1fr var(--cascade) var(--cascade);
  grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  row-gap: 14px;
  column-gap: 0;
}

.rating:nth-of-type(1) {
  --index: 1;
}

.rating:nth-of-type(2) {
  --index: 2;
}

.rating:nth-of-type(3) {
  --index: 3;
}

.rating {
  grid-row-start: var(--index);
  grid-column-start: var(--index);
  grid-column-end: calc(var(--index) + 3);
}
```

### Continued development

Not sure what I want to work on next. I think I did a good job with font sizing, font-weights, and letter spacing in this challenge, so that is improving for me. And I also think I leveraged both flex and grid in appropriate and elegant ways.

I definitely need to spent more time on accessibility, so will focus on improving that in a revision of this solution.
